Attempt to recreate the Google search page visually in html and CSS.
The Google search functionality hasn't been added at this stage.
Links are dead links <a href=#>
While there might be errors in the colour scheme and I have deliberately made up the names of the links, I'm reasonably happy with this first product.
I tried initially to build this visually. This is my first ever code from scratch.  After a while, I realised that it was easier to use the CSS grid and flex options.
